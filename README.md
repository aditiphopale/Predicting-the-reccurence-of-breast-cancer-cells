# Predicting-the-reccurence-of-breast-cancer-cells
The target problem of the Breast cancer dataset is to predict whether the recurrence of the breast cancer cells will occur or not for the given observations depending on all other attributes provided in the dataset.

The dataset is a Breast Cancer dataset which includes observations provided by the Oncology Institute. The dataset gives information about the cancer affected people including their age, the tumor size, grade of tumor etc. and provides information if the breast cancer cells reoccur or not for each observation. 

Data Description: 
The Breast Cancer dataset consists of a total of 287 observations and 10 attributes out of which 9 are independent variables and 1 being the target variable.

Description of all the attributes:
•	Age (age range): 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, ...
•	Menopause (time of menopause): lt40, ge40, premeno.
•	Tumor-size (size of the tumor excised in mm): 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, ...
•	Lymph-nodes (a metric of the presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes): 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, ...
•	Node-caps (evidence that cancer cells went through the capsule of the lymph nodes): yes, no
•	Grade of the tumor: (low, intermediate, high): 1, 2, 3.
•	Affected breast: left, right.
•	Quadrant of the breast: left-up, left-low, right-up, right-low, central.
•	Radiotherapy: yes, no.
•	Recurrence of breast cancer cells (Target Variable):  no-recurrence-events, recurrence-events

Target Problem:
The target problem of the Breast cancer dataset is to predict whether the recurrence of the breast cancer cells will occur or not for the given observations depending on all other attributes provided in the dataset.
As the data is being used to predict a categorical variable, the supervised learning algorithm used is Classification

The project is developed in R studio ver 1.2
